# opticalCNN

Under preparation...

Our code was run with Python 3.5.5 and Tensorflow 1.9.0 

Main files:
- optical_correlator.py: optimizes a simple model with a single layer
- onn_maskopt.py: optimizes a phase mask to correspond to a pre-computed PSF
- jupyter notebooks are useful for visualization, but in the current state they rely on files that may not be added yet
- more to be added

Additional code used to interface with prototype hardware is available upon request.
