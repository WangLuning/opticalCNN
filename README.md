# opticalCNN

Under preparation...

Our code was run with Python 3.5.5 and Tensorflow 1.9.0 

Main files:
- optical_correlator.py: optimizes a simple model with a single optical convolutional layer, with options in the code to switch to a single tf.conv layer or fully connected layer.
- onn_maskopt.py: optimizes a phase mask to correspond to a pre-computed PSF
- more to be added

Additional code used to interface with prototype hardware is available upon request.
